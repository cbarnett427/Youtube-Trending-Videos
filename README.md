# Introduction & Background

YouTube is the world's second largest search engine with 22.77 billion total visits according to the latest traffic report.
As one of the most popular Social Media platforms, providing video content for art & entertainment, YouTube spans across cultures and nations, with its trending videos viewed by a wide range of audiences around the globe. Thus, learning about characteristics of trending YouTube videos supports the design and evaluation of personalization services, from precise advertising to recommender systems.

Trending videos on youtube range from movie trailers to talk show interviews all the way to home videos. YouTube has said that "Trending" aims to display videos that are interesting to a wide audience and display what is happening on YouTube and what is happening around the world. This list of trending videos is the same for all users in each country, with an exception in India. Since Trending isn’t personalized and is the same for all users, it is a great list for YouTube creators to be on as it gives their video more chances of being watched.

# Data Description
